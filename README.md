# SRE Secure K8s Infra

🚀 Production-grade, secure-by-default Kubernetes infrastructure built with Terraform, instrumented with observability tools, and designed for forensic readiness.

## 🔍 What’s Inside

- 📦 Kubernetes cluster via Terraform
- 🔒 Runtime security via Falco
- 📊 Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana + Loki
- 🧪 Forensic logging and mock incident handling
- 🔁 GitHub Actions CI/CD + vulnerability scans (Trivy, tfsec)

## 💻 Tech Stack

| Component        | Tool           |
|------------------|----------------|
| Infra-as-Code    | Terraform      |
| Container Orchestration | Kubernetes |
| Monitoring       | Prometheus + Grafana |
| Logging          | Fluent Bit + Loki |
| Security         | Falco + Trivy |
| CI/CD            | GitHub Actions |
| Forensics        | Manual + Auditd |

## 🧠 Goal

Demonstrate how SRE and Cybersecurity can align to create resilient, secure, and monitorable systems — ready for incident response.

## 🛠️ Next Steps

1. Terraform infra provisioning
2. Kubernetes manifests and observability
3. Security integration (runtime + static)
4. Simulated incident with writeup
